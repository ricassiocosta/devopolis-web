# Devopolis <br>

Devopolis is a social network created with the aim of bringing together developers who share the same interests, so that they can exchange experiences and participate in a community that encourages them to always evolve.

## About

This project was created during the Supervised Internship II discipline, with the collaboration of <a href="https://github.com/olucasgomes">Lucas Gomes</a>, my course colleague. <br>
The frontend of this application was created using React.js and some libraries of stylization, authentication and access control.

If you want to test the application on your machine, just perform a 'clone' of this repository, or simply download both this repository, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/ricassiocosta/Devopolis-api/">backend</a> repositories. Then just run the following codes:

<strong>yarn install</strong>
then
<strong>yarn start</strong>
