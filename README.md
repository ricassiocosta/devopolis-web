# Devopolis <br>
Devopolis is a social network created with the aim of bringing together developers who share the same interests, so that they can exchange experiences and participate in a community that encourages them to always evolve.

## About
This project was created during the Supervised Internship II discipline, with the collaboration of <a href="https://github.com/olucasgomes">Lucas Gomes</a>, my course colleague. <br>
The frontend of this application was created using React.js and some libraries of stylization, authentication and access control.
